# Scalazzi

This project is configuration to enforce the [scalazzi](http://yowconference.com.au/slides/yowwest2014/Morris-ParametricityTypesDocumentationCodeReadability.pdf) safe subset of scala with [scalafix](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/docs/users/installation).

To install, first install scalafix and then use this `scalafix.conf` in your project. [A simpler, and more configurable, installation will follow shortly.](https://github.com/scalaz/scalazzi/issues/2)

If you would like to contribute to this initiative you can:

- [expand the list of manually verified "safe" methods](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [implement and improve scalazzi rules inside scalafix](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalafix/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ascalazzi)
